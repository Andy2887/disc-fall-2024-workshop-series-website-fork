## Workshop Topics

- **Visual Studio Code: Installation and Overview**  
  We began by discussing what a text editor and an IDE are, introducing Visual Studio Code as a versatile tool for coding. We also highlighted alternatives such as IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text, and Neovim.

- **How to Install Visual Studio Code**  
  Step-by-step installation instructions for setting up Visual Studio Code on your machine, including platform-specific tips.

- **Using the Interface**  
  We explored the essential components of the VS Code interface:

  - Opening folders and files
  - Using the built-in terminal, including split terminals and different terminal types
  - Understanding the sidebar tools (File Explorer, Search, Extensions)
  - Common extensions such as GitLens, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.

- **Configuring VS Code for JS/TS Development**  
  Demonstration of useful configurations like formatting on save, keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V`, `Cmd + P`), and adding the `code` command to your terminal PATH for quick access.

- **Introduction to Git**  
  Overview of Git as a version control system. Topics covered:

  - Initializing a new Git repository
  - Adding and committing files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`)
  - Creating and viewing the history of commits (`git log`)
  - Pushing code to GitHub and adding collaborators.

- **Branching and Merging**  
  We introduced branching, covering:

  - Creating new branches (`git checkout -b branchname`)
  - Merging branches into the main branch, pushing changes, and resolving conflicts directly in VS Code.

- **Pull Requests and Reviews**  
  A detailed walkthrough on creating a pull request, reviewing changes, and resolving merge conflicts.

- **Advanced Git Features**  
  We covered rebasing (`git rebase`), squashing commits, and the differences between merge and rebase strategies. We also introduced forking and its utility in collaborative development.
