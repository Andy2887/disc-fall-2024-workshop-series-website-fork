title: Assignment 7 - Building a PostgreSQL-Integrated API
---

In this assignment, you’ll be creating a user database in PostgreSQL, 
developing a basic API with Node and Express to interact with this database, 
and integrating it with a frontend application. 
The focus will be on implementing and connecting a RESTful API to manage user data effectively.

## Core requirements

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**  
  Start by setting up a PostgreSQL database with one table named `users`.

  - **Table Schema**:

    - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each user (e.g., `SERIAL` or `UUID`).
    - `first_name`: String, stores the first name of the user.
    - `last_name`: String, stores the last name of the user.
    - `email`: String, stores the user’s email address (make this unique if possible).
    - Any additional fields of your choice (e.g., `created_at`, `is_active`, etc.).

  - **Connection & Environment Variables**
    - Store database credentials (host, port, database name, user, password) 
    in an `.env` file to keep them secure.
    - Remember not to push the `.env` file to GitHub to protect your sensitive information.

### 2. API Development

- **Repository**  
  Create a new GitHub repository specifically for your API code. 
  You can name it something like "users-api".
  Use clear, consistent commit messages to document your progress.

- **API Endpoints**  
  Using Node and Express, create a new server with one endpoint to interact with the `users` table:

  - **GET `/users`**: Retrieve all users from the database.
    - Return the full list of users in JSON format.
    - Ensure this endpoint is connected to the `users` table and successfully retrieves data
    using `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

- **Connecting to Frontend**  
  Integrate this API with your React frontend using a `localhost` endpoint. 
  In [workshop 5](/content/workshops/workshop-7), we covered how to make API requests from the frontend.
  Feel free to push these changes to the `main` branch.

  - **Environment Configuration**:
    - Use an `.env` file to store sensitive information (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`).
    - Double-check that `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent pushing it to GitHub.

## Additional Requirements

- **Enhanced Database Schema**  
  Add additional columns to the `users` table that might be relevant 
  (e.g., `date_of_birth`, `profile_picture_url`, etc.) to further enrich the user data.
- **Additional API Endpoints**  
  Enhance your API by adding more functionality:

  - **POST `/users`**: Create a new user and add them to the database.
  - **DELETE `/users/:id`**: Delete a user by ID.
  - **PUT `/users/:id`**: Update a user’s information by ID.

  - Connect these endpoints to the frontend to allow full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- The workshop 7 slides and recordings, which you can find [here](/content/workshops/workshop-7).

## Submission

1. **Database**

   - Run `SHOW TABLES;` (or the equivalent command) to display the schema of the `users` table. 
   You will submit a screenshot of the output.
   - Run `SELECT * FROM users;` to display the data in your table.
   You will submit a screenshot of the output.
   - Take a screenshot of your database setup and connection in Render.
   Name this screenshot `database_verification.png` and store it in the root folder
   of your API repository.

2. **API**

   - You will submit a link to the GitHub repository that contains your API code.
     - In your API repo, add a `README.md` file that explains your approach, 
     key takeaways, and any challenges you encountered during the assignment.
     This will help your reviewers understand your work in detail.
   - You will submit a link to your frontend repository and specify the 
   line of code where the API connection is implemented.

Good luck, and remember to carefully structure your code and keep your environment variables secure!
